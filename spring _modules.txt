Spring Modules
_____________

1) spring core and spring beans provide fundamental part of the framework jaise ki IOC and Dependency Injection Factures.

2) 
The Context module inherits its features from the Beans module and adds support for internationalization
(using, for example, resource bundles), event propagation, resource loading, and the transparent
creation of contexts by, for example, a Servlet container. The Context module also supports Java EE
features such as EJB, JMX, and basic remoting. 


3)The spring-expression module provides a powerful Expression Language for querying and
manipulating an object graph at runtime.

_________________________________________________________________________________________
AOP - ascpect oriented programming - allowing you to define, for example, method interceptors and pointcuts to cleanly
decouple code that implements functionality that should be separated. 


The spring-instrument module provides class instrumentation support and classloader
implementations to be used in certain application servers



Messaging
to serve as a
foundation for messaging-based applications. The module also includes a set of annotations for mapping
messages to methods, similar to the Spring MVC annotation based programming model

___________________________________________________________________________________
Data Access/Integration: 
The spring-jdbc module provides a JDBC-abstraction layer that removes the need to do tedious
JDBC coding and parsing of database-vendor specific error codes.

The spring-orm module provides integration layers for popular object-relational mapping APIs,
including JPA and Hibernate. 

The spring-oxm module provides an abstraction layer that supports Object/XML mapping
implementations such as JAXB, Castor, JiBX and XStream.


The spring-jms module (Java Messaging Service) contains features for producing and consuming
messages. Since Spring Framework 4.1, it provides integration with the spring-messaging module.

__________________________________________________________________________________________
WEB

The spring-web module provides basic web-oriented integration features such as multipart file upload
functionality and the initialization of the IoC container using Servlet listeners and a web-oriented
application context. It also contains an HTTP client and the web-related parts of Springâ€™s remoting
support.


Testing 

__________
The spring-test module supports the unit testing and integration testing of Spring components with
JUnit or TestNG. It provides consistent loading of Spring ApplicationContexts and caching of those
contexts. It also provides mock objects that you can use to test your code in isolation
